	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the amount of time it takes to execute as a function of the size of the input. It helps in understanding how the execution time of an algorithm grows with the increase in input size. An algorithm with efficient time complexity is one that can solve problems quickly, even for large inputs.</p>
	<p>Space Complexity is another important aspect to consider when analyzing algorithms. It refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to execute as a function of the input size. In Big O notation, we often represent Space Complexity as O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> analysis is crucial for optimizing memory usage and ensuring that algorithms are not consuming excessive resources.</p>
