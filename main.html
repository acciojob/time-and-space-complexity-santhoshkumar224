    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity measures how efficient an algorithm performs, guiding developers to choose the most optimal solution as input sizes increase</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b>measures the memory usage of an algorithm, often represented as O(n), to ensure efficient resource management.</p>
